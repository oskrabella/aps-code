This is a single page Angular application that was made as part of a coding interview question for Amherst Pierpont.

To run the application, please:

 1) Run 'npm install' in terminal at the directory root to install dependencies.
 2) Run 'ng serve' to run the application.

To test the application, please:

1) Run 'ng test' in terminal at the directory root.

Question Instructions:

Create a single page Angular application that takes response from an API and displays the returned results on a screen. The results should be given to a re-usable component that creates a list for all entries, and a re-usable child component is rendered for each entry in the list.

This task is intended to not take up too much of your time and take approximately 1 hour. The completed source code should be shared via github.

Further information:

-API to be used: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos

-Angular should be used as the front-end framework

-Use any open-source libraries you would like

-Use your preferred design pattern and coding standards

-Automated unit testing required

-Provide a well laid out screen with good CSS practices. (Use your imagination)

-Add a read me file with commands to compile, test and run the application

Please send any questions you have via email

# ApsCode

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.0.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
